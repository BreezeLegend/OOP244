Workshop 7 was not that really hard but somethings I did learn was how to access shadowed member functions and how to 
shadow a base class member functions. Another thing I did learn was how to properly use input and out operators 
Somethings I learned while writing this code was how to use friend before a function, another thing I also learned 
was how to use another file as a friend in the class. In Milestone 2 there wasnt anything too complicated instead of 
writing alot of functions. In Milestone 3 it was the same as Milestone 2 in the sense there wasnt anything too 
complicated as we only had to write a few functions. Some issues while writing the code was that of how to properly 
use the ostream and istream functions as only one of the functions needed ampersand and it took a little bit of searching 
to figure what the problem was. There were really no other problems I had in any of the milestones or the workshop.
