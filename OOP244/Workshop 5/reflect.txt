Some things that I learned while writing this code was how to manage dynamic memory in a class, I also learned how to 
dynamically allocated memory within a class. The final thing that I learned was how to overload members and helper functions
in a class. Some problems that I have while writing this code was with setprecision I had to look up how to only use it 
for engines and not everything else.
