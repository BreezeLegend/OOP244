Workshop 8 was not that really hard but somethings that I learned while writing the code was how to implement a pure 
virtual function into my code, another thing that I learned was that I learned to use a abstract base class. Other than
the things I stated before I didnt really have much trouble understanding and writing the code, other than some visual
studio bugs which required fixing. But besides that it was to complicated as we are just using previously used code from
earlier in workshop. Milestone 4 was a little bit complicated as I had to look up some things such as unsigned and 
strcicmp, strcicmp helped with changing the plate numbers to uppercase and unsigned which helped with using an integer 
to portray a true and false statement.
