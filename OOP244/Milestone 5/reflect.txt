The Workshop was very simple and not very complicated as all you needed to add was one header file with one function 
and a few lines of code, at the end of the day not very complicated. Milestone 5 was very self explanitory as bascially
we only had to write the Car module and could just copy over the code you wrote in the car module into the Motorcycle
module and just change car to sidecar and with a few adjustments you have finished the code. One thing I did learn was 
how to use override in an istream and ostream function.
