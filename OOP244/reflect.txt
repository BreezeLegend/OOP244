Some issues that that were present when writing this code was when I was trying to use the ParkingData.csv and how to 
incorporate it into the program using ifstream and ofstream. Some other problems were that I was getting nine parking 
spots left instead of the eight in the output example. Other than those few problems there were really not hiccups and 
the writing process went smoothly. Thanks for having you Hong and wish you all the best and hopefully I can get a class 
with you in the future.
